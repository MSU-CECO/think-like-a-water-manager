Irrigation methods are usually classified into a small set of broad, ""primary"" systems.  
The four universally-recognized primary systems are:  

1. Surface irrigation (includes furrow, border, basin, etc.)  
2. Sprinkler irrigation (includes solid-set, hand-move, center pivot, travelling gun, etc.)  
3. Microirrigation (also called drip or trickle)  
4. Subirrigation (subsurface application, either natural or artificial)

The multiple-choice options mix individual sub-methods with these broad categories.  
Only option D lists exactly the four broad, primary categories themselves—without mixing in their sub-types.

A) Mixes a sprinkler subtype, microirrigation (primary), and two surface sub-methods, but omits sprinkler as a category and omits subirrigation.  
B) Mixes several sub-types and again omits microirrigation as a category.  
C) Contains only sub-types and omits two entire primary systems.  
D) Gives the four primary irrigation systems: surface, sprinkler, microirrigation, and subirrigation.

Therefore, option D is the correct combination.

### ANSWER
My answer is D

### CONFIDENCE RATE
My confidence is 0.83

### CONFIDENCE EXPLANATION
The broad classification of irrigation systems into four primary types is standard in irrigation engineering literature, and only option D lists all four without mixing subcategories, so I am reasonably confident (though not absolutely certain) that D is correct.","You are an expert in types of irrigation systems.

The knowledge graph tells us that there are four “primary types” of on-farm irrigation systems:
1. surface irrigation  
2. sprinkler irrigation  
3. microirrigation  
4. subirrigation  

These are the only categories listed under the node “primary types.”  
We simply need the option that lists those four—no extra or missing categories.

• Option A replaces “sprinkler irrigation” with “solid-set sprinkler,” adds “furrow,” and omits “subirrigation.”  
• Option B introduces “solid-set sprinkler,” “travelling gun,” “furrow,” and “basin” in addition to “subirrigation.”  
• Option C lists only “furrow,” “basin,” and “travelling gun,” leaving out two primary types.  
• Option D lists exactly the four primary types shown in the graph: surface, sprinkler, microirrigation, and subirrigation.

Therefore, the correct combination is Option D.

### ANSWER
My answer is D

### CONFIDENCE RATE
My confidence is 0.9

The user wants me to identify the correct combination of primary irrigation systems from the given options.

1.  **Identify the Primary Categories of Irrigation:** The first step is to establish the main, high-level classifications of irrigation systems used in agriculture. Based on how water is applied to the land, agricultural irrigation is broadly categorized into four primary types:
    *   **Surface Irrigation:** Water is applied to the surface of the field and distributed by gravity. This is the oldest and most common method. It includes sub-types like furrow, basin (flood), and border irrigation.
    *   **Sprinkler Irrigation:** Water is pumped through pipes and sprayed over the crops, simulating rainfall. Sub-types include center-pivot, linear move, solid-set, and travelling gun systems.
    *   **Microirrigation (or Drip/Trickle Irrigation):** Water is applied slowly and directly to the plant's root zone at low pressure through a network of pipes and emitters. This is a highly efficient method. Sub-types include drip, micro-sprinkler, and subsurface drip irrigation.
    *   **Subirrigation (or Seepage Irrigation):** Water is applied below the soil surface, either by artificially raising the water table or through buried pipes that release water into the root zone from below.

2.  **Evaluate the Multiple Choice Options:** Now, I will analyze each option based on the established primary categories. The question asks for the ""primary"" systems, which implies these main categories, not a list of specific techniques (sub-types).

    *   **A) solid-set sprinkler; microirrigation; furrow; surface:** This option is incorrect because it mixes levels of classification. `Microirrigation` and `surface` are primary categories. However, `solid-set sprinkler` is a sub-type of Sprinkler Irrigation, and `furrow` is a sub-type of Surface Irrigation. Including both `surface` and `furrow` is redundant and illogical.

    *   **B) solid-set sprinkler; travelling gun; furrow; basin; subirrigation:** This option is also incorrect. It lists `subirrigation`, which is a primary category, but the rest are all specific sub-types. `Solid-set sprinkler` and `travelling gun` are types of Sprinkler Irrigation. `Furrow` and `basin` are types of Surface Irrigation. This list omits the primary categories of Surface, Sprinkler, and Microirrigation.

    *   **C) furrow; basin; travelling gun:** This option is incorrect and incomplete. It lists only three specific techniques (sub-types) from two different primary categories (`furrow` and `basin` are Surface; `travelling gun` is Sprinkler). It completely misses the Microirrigation and Subirrigation categories.

    *   **D) surface; sprinkler; microirrigation; subirrigation:** This option correctly and completely lists the four recognized primary categories of irrigation systems. Each term represents a major, distinct method of applying water.

3.  **Conclusion:** Option D is the only one that accurately presents the standard, high-level classification of primary irrigation systems.

### ANSWER
My answer is D

### CONFIDENCE RATE
My confidence is 1.0

### CONFIDENCE EXPLANATION
Because, the classification of irrigation systems into the four primary categories of Surface, Sprinkler, Microirrigation, and Subirrigation is a fundamental and universally accepted standard in agricultural engineering and agronomy. Option D perfectly reflects this established classification, whereas the other options incorrectly mix these primary categories with their specific sub-types, making them either redundant, incomplete, or logically inconsistent.","You are an expert in types of irrigation systems.

1.  The problem requires identifying the correct combination of ""primary irrigation systems"" based on the provided contextual knowledge graph.
2.  I will examine the knowledge graph to find the node representing ""primary types"" of irrigation systems.
3.  The graph contains the node `(primary types)`. I will look for all concepts connected to this node with relationships like `-[INCLUDES]->` or `-[CONTAINS_CONCEPT]->`.
4.  The following relationships are found in the knowledge graph:
    *   `(primary types) -[CONTAINS_CONCEPT]-> (surface irrigation)`
    *   `(primary types) -[INCLUDES]-> (sprinkler irrigation)`
    *   `(primary types) -[INCLUDES]-> (microirrigation)`
    *   `(primary types) -[INCLUDES]-> (subirrigation)`
5.  These four relationships clearly define the primary types of irrigation systems as: surface irrigation, sprinkler irrigation, microirrigation, and subirrigation.
6.  Now, I will evaluate the multiple-choice options against this derived list.
    *   **A) solid-set sprinkler; microirrigation; furrow; surface:** This option contains sub-types like ""solid-set sprinkler"" and ""furrow"", which are not the main primary categories.
    *   **B) solid-set sprinkler; travelling gun; furrow; basin; subirrigation:** This option is mostly composed of specific sub-types of irrigation systems, not the primary categories.
    *   **C) furrow; basin; travelling gun:** This option only lists sub-types.
    *   **D) surface; sprinkler; microirrigation; subirrigation:** This option perfectly matches the four primary types identified directly from the knowledge graph.

7.  Therefore, option D is the only one that correctly lists the primary irrigation systems as defined in the context.

### ANSWER
My answer is D

### CONFIDENCE RATE
My confidence is 1.0

### CONFIDENCE EXPLANATION
Because, the knowledge graph explicitly and unambiguously connects the concept `(primary types)` to `(surface irrigation)`, `(sprinkler irrigation)`, `(microirrigation)`, and `(subirrigation)`.

To solve this problem, I need to identify the primary categories of irrigation systems used in agriculture and determine which option provides the most comprehensive and correct combination.

The main categories of irrigation systems are:

1. **Surface irrigation** - This includes furrow irrigation, basin irrigation, and border irrigation. Water flows over the soil surface by gravity.

2. **Sprinkler irrigation** - This includes solid-set sprinklers, traveling gun sprinklers, center pivot systems, etc. Water is distributed through pressurized spray.

3. **Microirrigation** - This includes drip irrigation, micro-sprinklers, and other localized irrigation methods that apply water directly to plant root zones.

4. **Subirrigation** - Water is applied below the soil surface or the water table is controlled to provide moisture to plant roots from below.

Now let me evaluate each option:

A) Lists specific types (solid-set sprinkler, microirrigation, furrow) plus the broad category ""surface"" - this mixes specific methods with broad categories inconsistently.

B) Lists mostly specific methods (solid-set sprinkler, travelling gun, furrow, basin, subirrigation) - this is more of a list of specific techniques rather than primary system categories.

C) Lists only three specific methods (furrow, basin, travelling gun) - this is incomplete and doesn't represent all primary irrigation categories.

D) Lists the four main broad categories (surface, sprinkler, microirrigation, subirrigation) - this provides a complete classification of primary irrigation systems at the appropriate categorical level.

Option D represents the most logical and complete categorization of primary irrigation systems, covering all major approaches used in agriculture.

### ANSWER
My answer is D

### CONFIDENCE RATE
My confidence is 0.9

### CONFIDENCE EXPLANATION
Because option D provides the most comprehensive and systematically correct classification of the four primary irrigation system categories used in agriculture, while the other options either mix categorical levels inconsistently or are incomplete in their coverage of irrigation methods.","You are an expert in types of irrigation systems.

Let me analyze the knowledge graph to identify the primary irrigation systems:

From the knowledge graph, I can see that:
1. (primary types) -[INCLUDES]-> (sprinkler irrigation)
2. (primary types) -[INCLUDES]-> (microirrigation) 
3. (primary types) -[INCLUDES]-> (subirrigation)
4. (primary types) -[CONTAINS_CONCEPT]-> (surface irrigation)

This tells me that the four primary types of irrigation systems are:
- Surface irrigation
- Sprinkler irrigation
- Microirrigation
- Subirrigation

Now let me examine each option:

Option A: ""solid-set sprinkler; microirrigation; furrow; surface""
- Solid-set sprinkler is a type of sprinkler irrigation (not a primary category)
- Furrow is a type of surface irrigation (not a primary category)
- This mixes primary categories with subcategories

Option B: ""solid-set sprinkler; travelling gun; furrow; basin; subirrigation""
- Contains specific methods rather than primary categories
- Mixes primary (subirrigation) with subcategories

Option C: ""furrow; basin; travelling gun""
- These are all specific methods, not primary categories
- Only lists 3 items when there should be 4 primary types

Option D: ""surface; sprinkler; microirrigation; subirrigation""
- Lists exactly the four primary irrigation system categories identified in the knowledge graph
- Matches perfectly with what the graph shows as primary types

### ANSWER
My answer is D

### CONFIDENCE RATE
My confidence is 0.95

### CONFIDENCE EXPLANATION
Because the knowledge graph clearly shows four primary irrigation types (surface, sprinkler, microirrigation, and subirrigation) through the INCLUDES and CONTAINS_CONCEPT relationships, and option D is the only choice that lists exactly these four primary categories without mixing in subcategories or specific methods.","You are an expert in types of irrigation systems.

The question asks for the correct combination of primary irrigation systems. According to the context, the **primary types** of irrigation systems are explicitly listed as **surface irrigation**, **sprinkler irrigation**, **microirrigation**, and **subirrigation**. These are the core categories. Other terms like ""furrow,"" ""basin,"" ""solid-set sprinkler,"" ""travelling gun,"" or ""center pivots"" are sub-concepts or specific implementations within these primary types. 

- **Option A** includes ""furrow"" (a surface irrigation method) and ""solid-set sprinkler"" (a sprinkler irrigation method), but the question asks for primary systems, not their subtypes. While ""surface"" and ""microirrigation"" are primary types, the inclusion of subtypes makes this option less accurate.
- **Option B** includes ""subirrigation"" (a primary type) but omits ""microirrigation"" and includes subtypes like ""furrow,"" ""basin,"" and ""travelling gun.""
- **Option C** lists only subtypes of surface and sprinkler irrigation, not the primary types themselves.

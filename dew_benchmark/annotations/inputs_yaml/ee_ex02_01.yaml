  base_text: "\nA farmer is planning to install a center pivot sprinkler irrigation
    system on his corn field farm ({TIA} acres). There is no existing irrigation system.
    After considering the installation (pivot, sprinklers, pump, motor, etc.), contingencies
    and tax fees, the total cost for setting up the system was estimated to be ${TECOIS}.
    From there, the ownership cost per year has been estimated: ${OCPY}. As for the
    operating costs (per a unit of acre), those related to the electric power consumption
    amounted to ${OPCDEP}, repair and maintenance-related costs were ${OPCDRM}. Consider
    ${OPCO} to cover the increased costs of oil, fertilizer, chemicals, labor, etc.
    required to obtain the {TIA} bushel increase in yield.\nNote that the unit price
    asssociated with the expected increase of yield from irrigation is ${UPEI}.\n\n\
    - Question 1: What is the gross value per acre of expected increase from irrigation?\
    \ \n- Question 2: What is the total increased ownership costs per acre? \n- Question
    3: What is the total increased operating costs per acre? \n- Question 4: What
    is the total average annual cost increase per acre? \n- Question 5: What will
    be the expected average annual increase in net income per acre? "
  problem_text: "In Illinois, a farmer is planning to install a center pivot sprinkler
    irrigation system on a corn field covering {TIA} acres during the growing season
    of May to September. The total setup cost is estimated at ${TECOIS}, with annual
    ownership costs of ${OCPY}. Operating costs include ${OPCDEP} for power, ${OPCDRM}
    for maintenance, and ${OPCO} for additional expenses. The expected yield increase
    is {TIA} bushels, with a unit price of ${UPEI}.  \n\nQuestion: What will be the

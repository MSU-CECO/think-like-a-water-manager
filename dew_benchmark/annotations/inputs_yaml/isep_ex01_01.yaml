  base_text: " Consider a {TIA} acres farm where alfafa is being grown. The management
    allowed deficit is at 3.59% and the typical irrigation duration is {TID} every
    {TIF} days (using a surface irigation system). But assume that irrigation was
    applied a total of {NIRF} times by the end of the year. A graded furrow border
    system is operating on the farm: its border spacing: 31', strip width: 27', and
    wetted width and length are 30' and 699' respectively. The estimated current average
    net application per irrigation is {PANAPI} inches with an application efficiency
    at {PIEA}%. For potential irrigation amangement for alfafa, assume that the annual
    net irrigation requirement is {ANIR} inches with a potential application efficiency
    estimated at {PAE}%. The fuel (i.e., electric) cost per acre foot is $ {FCPAF}
    - note that the cost per unit of fuel was about 6.99 cents kwh and the pumping
    plant efficiency about 60%. The cost of water purchase per acre foot: {CPAF}.\n\
    \n- Question 1: Determine the potential gross irrigation applied by the end of
    the year. \n- Question 2: Find the total annual water conserved (i.e., the acre
    feet conserved per year). \n- Question 3: Find the total costs related to pumping
    by the end of the year. \n- Question 4: Find the annual water purchase cost. \n\
    - Question 5: What would be the total cost savings by the end of the year (if
    only onsidering costs related to pumping and water purchase)? "
  problem_text: " A Virginia-based farm, known for raising chicken, spans across {TIA} acres, which is used for producing grains and alfalfa under a surface irrigation system. 
                The management allows for a deficit of 3.59%, and the typical irrigation cycle occurs every {TIF} days, lasting {TID} hours per application. However, by the end of the year, irrigation was actually applied {NIRF} times. The farm utilizes a graded furrow border system, with a border spacing of 31 feet, strip width of 27 feet, and wetted dimensions of 30 feet wide and 699 feet long.
                The current average net application depth per irrigation is recorded at {PANAPI} inches, with an application efficiency of {PIEA} %. For potential irrigation improvements, the annual net irrigation requirement for alfalfa is estimated to be {ANIR} inches, with a projected application efficiency of {PAE}% . 
                Energy considerations include a fuel cost of $ {FCPAF} per acre-foot, based on an electricity rate of 6.99 cents per kilowatt-hour and a pumping plant efficiency of 60%. Additionally, the cost of water purchase stands at {CPAF} dollars per acre-foot.
                \nQuestion: What would be the total cost savings achieved by the end of the year if only the pumping and water purchase costs are considered?

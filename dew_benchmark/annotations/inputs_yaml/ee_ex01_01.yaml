  base_text: " A sprinkler-based irrigation system is operating on a {TIA}-acres farm.
    The operation pressure presently is {PRASC} {PRASC_unit} but later dropped to
    {PRASA} {PRASA_unit} after conversion. The seasonal gross irrigation application
    is {SGIA} {SGIA_unit} and the pumping plant overall estimated efficiency is {OPPE}

  problem_text: "A sprinkler-based irrigation system is utilized on a {TIA}-acre farm
    located in North Carolina, where broiler production and tomato cultivation coexist.
    The system initially operates at {PRASC} {PRASC_unit} pressure but experiences
    a reduction to {PRASA} {PRASA_unit} following a retrofit. The seasonal gross irrigation
    application amounts to {SGIA} {SGIA_unit}, with the pumping plant achieving an
    overall efficiency of {OPPE} %. Given the electric energy cost of $ {EEC} per
    kWh,  \n\nQuestion: What is the annual monetary savings resulting from the pressure
    adjustment?"

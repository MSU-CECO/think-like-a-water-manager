  base_text: "\nCorn (sileage) is being grown on a {TIA}-acres farm in an area with
    a loamy soil texture. Its actual root zone depth is about 3.9 inches and the management
    allowable depletion is 3.8 inches. A graded furrow irrigation system is operating
    on the farm. The farmer reported that the number of irrigations per year is {NIRF}
    (irrigation duration: {TID} hours, frequency: {TIF} days). The furrow length is
    {FL} {FL_unit} and the spacing is {FS} {FS_unit} with an average slope of 0.013
    feet/feet.\nAssume that the present gross depth of irrigation applied is {PGDA}
    {PGDA_unit}. For potential irrigation amangement, assume that the annual net irrigation
    requirement is {ANIR} inches with a potential application efficiency estimated
    at {PAE}%.\n\n- Question 1: Determine the potential gross irrigation applied by
    the end of the year. \n- Question 2: Find the total annual water conserved (i.e.,
    the acre feet conserved per year). \n- Question 3: Find the total costs related
    to pumping by the end of the year. \n- Question 4: Find the annual water purchase
    cost. \n- Question 5: What would be the total cost savings by the end of the year
    (if only onsidering costs related to pumping and water purchase)? "
